# P5.js Easing Motion Sketch

This is a P5.js sketch is a proof of concept that demonstrates various easing motions. The sketch allows you to interactively explore different easing functions by adjusting sliders for parameters such as offset, duration, amplitude, and easing type.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a web browser installed that supports HTML5 canvas rendering. Recommended browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.

### Running the Sketch

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

- Adjust sliders to modify parameters such as delay, duration, exponential value, and easing type.
- Explore different easing functions and observe their effects on the animated bars.
- The sketch visualizes the easing curve and provides real-time feedback on selected parameters.

## Controls

- **Delay Slider:** Adjusts the delay before the animation starts.
- **Duration Slider:** Sets the total duration of the animation.
- **Amplitude Slider:** Controls the intensity of the easing effect.
- **Easing Type Radio Buttons:** Select the desired easing function.

## Customization/Suggestions
